----------
This is the 'McuOnEclipseLibrary': a scalable C/C++ library from the McuOnEclipse () project.
The drivers are mostly generated by Processor Expert:
- lib/src: driver source and interface files
- lib/config: driver configuration header files

Additionally following middleware is provided:
- lib\FreeRTOS: FreeRTOS port for ARM Cortex-M (M0, M4, M7)
- lib\SEGGER_RTT: Port of the SEGGER RTT Library
- lib\SEGGER_Sysview: Port of the SEGGER SystemView Library
- lib\TraceRecorder: Port of the Percepio Tracealyzer library
- lib\HD44780: library for the HD44780 character display, see https://mcuoneclipse.com/2019/01/27/tutorial-hd44780-display-driver-with-nxp-mcuxpresso-sdk/

Make sure you follow the McuOnEclipse blog: http://mcuoneclipse.com/

How to use the library:
- download the repository zip file: https://github.com/ErichStyger/McuOnEclipseLibrary/archive/master.zip
- place the 'lib' folder into your Eclipse project and rename it to 'McuLib'. You can use any other name, but then you need to change the include paths accordingly
- Make sure that the folder is included in the build (see https://mcuoneclipse.com/2014/07/22/exclude-source-files-from-build-in-eclipse/)
- Add the following paths to the compiler include settings (you might simply copy-paste them into the control):
../McuLib/config
../McuLib/config/fonts
../McuLib/src
../McuLib/FreeRTOS/Source/include
../McuLib/FreeRTOS/Source/portable/GCC/ARM_CM4F
../McuLib/SEGGER_RTT
../McuLib/SEGGER_Sysview
../McuLib/TraceRecorder/config
../McuLib/TraceRecorder/include
../McuLib/TraceRecorder/streamports/Jlink_RTT/include
../McuLib/HD44780
- If the project contains a hard fault handler: disable or remove it, as the McuLib comes with its own (I think better) handler.

Enjoy!
Erich
